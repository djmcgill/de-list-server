# De-list server
This is an implementation of https://github.com/djmcgill/de-list-celeb intended for people to use as a service. If you don't trust my code (or my running server), download that script and run it instead.

This service is intended for people that can't (or won't) register as a twitter developer and then install Rust or Python.
